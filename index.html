      <p>Bloody Peasant! Who's that then? Who's that then? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We found them. Why do you think that she is a witch? What do you mean? The nose? Bring her forward! Look, my liege! Well, we did do the nose. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
      <p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Why? But you are dressed as oneâ€¦ The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Burn her!</p></p>
